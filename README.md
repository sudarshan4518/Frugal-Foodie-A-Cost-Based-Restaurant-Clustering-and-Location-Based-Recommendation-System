## 🔑 API Keys Required

To use the Google Maps APIs, you need to add your **Google API keys** in the `app.py` file.
Download the zomato dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data

### ⚠️ Note:
**DO NOT commit your original API keys to GitHub** — keep them private and secure.

In `app.py`, look for:
```python
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.
